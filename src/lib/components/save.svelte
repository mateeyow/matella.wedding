		<h3>Save the date</h3>
		<p>Hi [name],</p>
		<p>
			With the sound of the waves and the sunset at our backs, we are beyond thrilled to extend our
			heartfelt invitation to you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our special day promises a day filled with laughter, sunkissed skin, bottoms up, after-wedding
			hangover and most especially a memory that will linger in our hearts for a lifetime.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please join us in this "intimate but rowdy" celebration of our love. You are special to us,
			and we hope to share this moment with you like how you have shared your special moments with
			us.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are looking forward to celebrating with you. The courtesy of a reply is requested by May
			15, 2024.
