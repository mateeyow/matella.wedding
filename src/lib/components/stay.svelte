		<h3>Where can you stay?</h3>
		<p>
			Bali has everything for everyone. From five-star resorts, to thousands of smaller, yet just as
			amazing accommodations, and affordable Airbnbs
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are planning on staying for just a few days (3 nights 4days), and be there just for the
			wedding, you can opt to stay in these hotels:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Villa Plenilunio Terazza</li>
			<li>Four Seasons</li>
			<li>Renaissance Uluwatu</li>
			<li>Swissbel Hotel</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			These are full-service hotels and are close to our venue. Of the four hotels, we have made an
			arrangement with Villa Plenilunio Terazza. They can offer our guests a 15% discount. Our
			coordinators from @voweverwedding will be more than happy to make the arrangements for your
			bookings.

		<p>
			If you plan on staying for a week or more, we suggest you try booking a villa thorugh AirBnb.
			You can book as a group. If you are looking for a group to share a villa with, please message
			us and we will introduce you to the other guests. It will be a good way to meet other people
			too.
